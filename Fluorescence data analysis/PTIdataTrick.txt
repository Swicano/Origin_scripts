//  it is just a simple trick that i thought was worth writing down somewhere
//  
//  if you want to do some math just a little too complicated for the F(x) cell
//  you can set up ranges in the script window, then use them in the F(x) cell
//   
//  in this case F(x) cell simply read: inY/inC *0.02
//  and the script window read:

range inY = col(B)[1:281];
range inC = col(B)[289:569];

// another trick is calling the comment cell of another column, 
//  in case it contains numerical info, such as sample angle, or concentration
//  col(C)[C]$
